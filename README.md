## Personal Blog
Hi this is Wang Zixuan😃 Welcome to my personal homepage! I am a master’s student in statistics at the National University of Singapore (NUS), passionate about data science, statistical modeling, and financial analytics. Through this blog, I aim to share my learning experiences, coding projects, and personal growth as I navigate my academic and professional journey. My goal is to leverage my skills to land a role in the financial or data analytics industry.
