# Capturing Moments: My Journey in Photography & Travel 📸

Photography and travel have been more than just hobbies for me—they are my way of seeing the world and telling stories. Over the past four years, I’ve turned my love for photography into a business, running a studio that specializes in graduation portraits and personal photoshoots. The joy of capturing people’s most important milestones has not only been creatively fulfilling but also a sustainable source of income.  

Beyond the studio, I find inspiration in exploring new places. Travel allows me to experience different cultures, landscapes, and perspectives, all of which shape my photography in unexpected ways. Whether it’s the golden hour in a quiet city street or the raw beauty of a mountain sunrise, every trip adds new depth to my work.  

In this space, I’ll share my experiences—behind-the-scenes from my shoots, travel stories, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way. If you're passionate about photography, travel, or simply enjoy a good visual story, I hope you’ll find something here that resonates with you.
